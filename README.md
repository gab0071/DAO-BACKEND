In summary, this Ethereum smart contract is an implementation of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO is designed to allow participants to make proposals and vote on them to make decisions about the organization. The contract has several functions that allow users to create proposals, vote on existing proposals, execute approved proposals, and check various information about proposals and votes. The contract uses two interfaces: `IFakeNFTMarketplace` and `ICryptoDevsNFT`, which allow the contract to interact with a fake non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace and a specific NFT called `"CryptoDevsNFT"`. The contract also has several modifiers that restrict certain functions to only be called by certain types of users or in certain circumstances.

<h2> Requirements ‚¨á</h2>

- Anyone with a `CryptoDevs` NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace
- Everyone with a `CryptoDevs` NFT can vote for or against the active proposals
- Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal
- Voter cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT
- If majority of the voters vote for the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase is automatically executed
